1.964	4.332	3	If you're talking about something *simple, where you throw away a lot of these dimensions, then you can do that right away.
6.296	8.015	3	Talking about something that has all of these different facets that we have here, {inbreath} it won't happen quickly, it won't be easy, and there's all sorts of issues about th- you know {inbreath}
14.311	2.632	3	keeping the equipment safe, or else hauling it around, and
14.711	0.621	5	{breath}
15.873	0.678	5	{breath}
16.551	0.392	5	Huh.
16.943	0.812	5	Then maybe we should {mic.noise} ..
17.019	0.581	3	all sorts of o-
17.600	0.757	3	{inbreath}
17.755	1.476	5	try to bring people here. {mic.noise}
18.835	4.05	3	I think the first priority should be to pry to get - try to get people to come here.
19.058	0.286	1	Here.
19.231	1.257	5	I mean, that's that's - {mic.noise}
20.488	1.251	5	OK, (so).
22.885	0.925	3	We're set up for it.
22.935	0.35	4	Mmhm.
23.968	0.354	3	{inbreath}
24.107	0.549	5	O_K.
24.322	3.239	3	The room is - is really, uh, underused.
28.173	0.557	5	Right.
28.230	0.616	3	Uh
28.513	2.41	4	I thought the free lunch idea was a great idea.
29.790	0.74	5	{inbreath}
30.239	0.684	3	{inbreath}
30.247	0.844	1	Yeah, I thought so too.
30.530	1.419	5	Yeah, I - and -
30.923	1.026	3	Free lunch is good.
30.923	1.026	4	{inbreath}
31.349	0.486	2	Yeah.
31.949	7.402	5	I think we can get people to come here, that - but the issue is you definitely wanna make sure that the kind of group you're getting is the right group so that you don't waste a lot of
33.127	1.759	4	{breath}
39.751	2.228	5	your time {mic.noise} and the overhead in bringing people down.
41.157	0.39	4	Mmhm.
41.963	0.97	0	No crunchy food.
42.144	0.376	3	Yeah.
43.176	5.224	2	{laugh}
43.377	0.348	5	So
43.725	0.164	5	{laugh}
43.763	0.74	4	{laugh}
43.763	1.631	1	He- Well, I was thinking, lunch after.
43.889	2.335	5	Well, it would be .. lunch afterwards. Right.
46.224	1.208	3	{laugh}
46.224	2.186	5	And they'd have to do their digits or they don't get dessert.
47.105	0.772	4	{laugh}
47.432	2.928	3	Yeah, they have to do their digits or they don't {laughing} get - they don't {laughing} get their food.
47.885	0.283	1	Yep.
48.168	3.465	1	{laugh} {breath}
48.410	1.078	5	{laugh}
48.752	0.724	4	{laugh}
50.013	0.518	5	{inbreath}
50.360	0.843	3	{laugh}
50.531	0.485	5	Yeah.
50.837	0.43	4	{laugh}
51.203	0.368	3	Yeah
51.571	0.547	3	{inbreath}
51.633	4.043	1	Um, I had a - I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered.
52.460	1.496	3	{breath}
55.751	0.885	1	Should I pursue that?
57.070	1.508	5	Oh, definitely, yeah.
57.767	2.021	1	Yeah. {inbreath} So. They - they originally -
58.089	0.481	3	Yeah.
59.922	2.279	1	They've decided not to do - go into speech.
62.201	0.279	1	{inbreath}
62.480	6.056	1	So I'm not sure whether they'll still be so willing to volunteer, but I'll send an email and ask. I'll tell them about the free lunch. And they'll say there's no such thing.
63.592	1.445	3	{breath}
65.037	1.168	3	Tell them about the free lunch. {mic.noise}
66.244	0.934	5	Yeah.
67.178	0.74	5	Yeah.
68.536	0.198	1	{inbreath}
68.734	0.312	1	{inbreath}
68.734	1.114	3	{laugh}
68.745	1.162	2	{laugh}
69.036	3.35	5	I'd *love to get people that are not linguists or engineers,
69.046	0.297	1	So.
69.848	0.874	3	{inbreath}
71.973	0.495	3	Yeah.
71.981	0.454	1	Right.
72.386	1.957	5	cuz these are both weird
72.468	0.699	3	{inbreath}
72.644	0.502	2	Yeah.
73.167	0.644	3	The -
74.343	1.29	5	well, I know, I shouldn't say that {QUAL whispering}
75.084	0.652	3	{laugh}
75.096	3.812	2	{laugh}
75.633	0.716	5	{laugh} ..
75.736	0.635	3	The uh the other h-
75.737	1.594	1	That's alright. No the- they *are weird.
76.349	1.488	5	We need a wider sampling.
76.371	3.463	3	{breath}
77.837	5.000	5	{laugh}
78.088	4.595	1	{laugh}
79.531	1.611	2	{laugh}
79.834	0.624	0	"beep."
79.834	1.19	3	{laugh}
80.776	2.821	0	{laugh}
81.024	0.355	3	Uh.
81.142	3.979	2	Yeah. {laugh}
81.379	0.495	3	{laugh}
81.874	0.558	3	"beep."
82.432	1.165	3	{laugh}
82.683	0.914	1	a: {breath}
83.597	0.792	3	Uh, the - the
83.862	2.498	1	The problem with engineers is "beep"
85.718	2.208	3	{laugh} {inbreath} {squeak}
85.720	3.262	0	{laugh}
86.075	4.957	4	{laugh}
86.360	7.718	1	{laugh}
86.386	5.454	2	{laugh}
87.926	1.067	3	They make funny sounds.
88.982	0.637	0	{buzzer noise}
88.993	0.847	3	The o- the o- the other -
89.840	1.305	3	The other thing is,
91.145	3.977	3	uh, that we - we talked about is give to them - uh, burn an extra CD-ROM.
93.717	1.393	0	{laugh}
95.206	0.656	1	Yep,
95.206	0.616	3	{breath}
95.206	3.545	5	{laugh}
95.774	1.798	0	{breath}
95.822	4.17	3	and give them - So if they want a - basically and audio record of their -
95.862	0.971	1	Let them have their meeting.
97.572	1.369	0	{laugh}
98.751	1.241	5	Well, I thought that was -
99.992	7.758	5	I thought he meant, "Give them a music CD," like they g- {laugh} but it's a CD of their speech and I guess it depends of what kind of audience you're talking to, but
100.742	0.772	2	{laugh}
101.861	2.101	0	{laugh}
101.973	0.446	3	{inbreath}
102.015	1.697	1	{laugh}
102.419	0.47	3	Oh
102.889	0.512	3	{laugh}
102.962	0.597	2	{laugh}
107.750	3.008	5	you know, I personally {mic.noise} would not want a {mic.noise} C_D {laugh} of my meeting, but
109.129	1.074	3	{laugh}
110.407	0.436	1	of a meeting?
110.758	0.364	5	{inbreath}
110.943	1.112	3	{breath}
111.122	1.798	5	maybe - yeah .. maybe you're right
111.819	0.549	2	{laugh}
112.055	3.538	3	If you're having some planning meeting of some sort and uh .. you'd like -
114.624	1.225	0	Oh, that's a good idea.
114.686	0.549	5	Right,
115.212	0.647	1	It'd be fun.
115.235	0.613	5	right.
116.242	1.972	1	I think it would just be fun, you know, if nothing else, you know.
116.242	0.442	3	yeah.
116.242	0.565	5	Right.
116.378	0.334	2	Yeah.
116.986	1.003	3	{breath}
117.989	0.542	3	{inbreath}
118.531	1.127	3	But it als-
118.570	0.973	1	It's a novelty item.
118.570	0.638	5	Right.
119.658	5.728	3	It - it - it also I think builds up towards the goal. We're saying, "Look, you know, you're gonna get this. Is- is- isn't that neat. Then you're gonna go home with it."
123.785	2.371	0	{breath} {clear throat}
125.386	2.455	3	"It's actually - .. It's probably gonna be pretty useless to you,"
126.686	1.512	2	{laugh}
127.540	0.717	1	Yep. {laugh}
127.841	0.416	3	{laugh}
128.257	3.373	3	"but you'll ge- appreciate, you know, where it's useful and where it's useless,"
129.669	0.612	5	Right.
131.630	2.727	3	"and then, we're gonna move this technology, so it'll become useful."
134.357	0.684	3	So.
134.357	4.837	5	No, I think that's a great idea, actually. But we might need a little more to incentivize them {laugh}, that's all.
134.765	0.692	0	{sniff}
134.844	0.597	2	Yeah.
136.247	0.44	4	{inbreath}
136.356	4.112	0	What if you could tell them that you'll give them the - the transcripts when they come back?
136.687	0.29	4	Alth-
136.977	0.353	4	{breath}
139.194	1.526	5	{laugh}
140.720	0.266	1	Oh, yeah.
141.348	0.606	4	{inbreath}
141.557	0.652	3	Oh yeah.
141.606	1.662	1	I mean, anyone can have the transcripts,
141.954	0.401	4	Yeah.
142.980	0.587	5	{squeak}
143.268	0.31	1	so
143.268	1.032	4	{laugh}
143.567	1.028	5	Ah, that's interesting.
143.799	1.788	2	{laugh}
144.300	5.238	4	I hav- I have to uh raise a little eensy-weensy concern about doing th- giving them the CD immediately,
144.604	0.979	1	I thought we could point that out.
149.538	3.272	4	because of these issues of, you know, this kind of stuff, where
152.810	0.32	4	maybe,
153.130	0.534	4	{inbreath}
153.521	0.636	3	{inbreath}
153.664	0.477	4	you know.
154.157	0.43	3	Good point.
155.060	1.911	3	That's a very good point. So we can - so we can
155.060	0.291	4	So.
155.351	0.361	4	{inbreath}
155.712	2.443	4	We could burn it after it's been cleared with the transcript stage.
156.971	0.975	3	{breath}
158.463	0.804	3	Right.
158.670	2.069	4	And then they- they get a CD, but just not the same day.
159.108	1.591	5	Oh, right.
161.300	3.626	5	If - It should be the same CD-ROM that we distribute publically, right?
161.469	0.573	1	Yeah, that's right.
162.328	0.66	1	That's a good point.
163.147	0.724	3	{inbreath}
164.926	1.518	1	Right, it can't be the internal one.
164.926	2.427	5	Otherwise they're not allowed to
165.630	0.971	3	Although it's -
166.460	1.082	4	There we go, oh I like that.
167.344	1.396	1	That's right.
167.353	1.387	5	play it for anyone.
167.542	1.051	4	Well put, well put.
168.740	1.647	4	So, after the transcript screening phase.
169.768	0.567	3	{breath}
170.387	0.947	1	Yeah, that's true.
170.387	3.032	5	Otherwise we'd need *two lawyer stages.
171.111	0.987	4	Things have been weeded out.
173.013	3.644	4	Yeah, that's right, say "Yeah, well, I got this CD, and, Your Honor, I - "
173.419	5.549	5	{laugh}
173.784	0.978	3	{laugh}
175.371	1.011	3	{breath}
175.393	3.199	2	{laugh}
176.657	6.016	4	{laugh}
176.670	2.97	1	{laugh}
176.891	1.753	3	{laugh}
178.644	3.216	3	{breath}
178.968	1.177	5	That's a good point.
180.029	1.886	0	{laugh}
180.120	4.814	2	{laugh}
181.645	0.411	5	{inbreath}
181.860	2.198	3	Yeah so that's - so let's start with Haas, and
182.056	1.109	5	Alright, I have to -
184.058	0.366	3	Yeah.
184.088	1.472	5	Sorry I have to leave.
184.424	0.866	3	{inbreath}
185.560	0.505	3	Oh, that's fine.
185.560	1.868	5	I will be here full time next week.
186.806	0.637	4	{mic.noise}
187.027	0.31	2	{cough}
187.428	1.082	5	{mic.noise}
187.491	0.579	1	O_K, see you.
188.510	1.35	5	{mic.noise} {QUAL takes microphone off and leaves}
188.834	1.082	3	{breath}
189.916	0.629	3	O_K.
191.606	0.484	1	No.
192.090	8.967	default	{mic.noise}
193.052	0.347	3	(Sorry)
193.471	1.989	4	{mic.noise}
193.702	0.664	3	{breath}
194.275	0.395	0	See you.
194.366	0.513	3	O_K.
194.879	1.341	3	{sip coffee?}
195.167	0.358	2	See you.
196.416	3.111	2	{breath}
197.345	2.046	3	So, uh ..
199.391	1.564	3	Let's see. So that was that topic,
200.955	0.999	3	and ..
201.057	0.500	default	{door closes}
201.954	0.696	3	{breath}
202.650	2.63	3	then um, I guess another topic would be ..
205.280	0.326	3	{breath}
205.880	3.74	3	"where are we in the whole disk resources .. question?" for -
208.572	0.688	1	{laugh}
209.260	0.692	1	{inbreath}
209.952	2.701	1	We are slowly slowly getting to the point where ..
211.200	0.413	3	{breath}
212.653	3.267	1	we have uh enough sp- room to record meetings. ..
215.892	0.815	3	{laugh}
215.920	0.438	1	{inbreath}
216.358	2.355	1	So I uh did a bunch of archiving, and
218.713	3.707	1	still doing a bunch of archiving, I - I'm in the midst of doing
222.420	1.37	1	the P_files from uh,
223.790	0.5	1	{inbreath}
224.290	0.8	1	Broadcast News?
225.090	0.44	1	{inbreath}
225.530	1.74	1	and it took eleven hours
227.270	0.51	1	{inbreath}
227.521	0.756	2	Eleven?
227.780	0.579	1	to do -
228.359	0.68	1	to copy it,
229.039	2.422	1	and it'll take *another eleven to do the clone.
230.053	1.317	0	Where did you copy it to?
231.461	0.82	1	{breath}
232.281	0.619	1	Well, it's abbott.
233.749	0.951	1	It's abbott, so it just
235.090	1.786	1	but it's - it's a lot of data. {laugh}
235.581	0.428	3	Sk-
236.574	2.216	3	It's copying from one place on abbott to another place on abbott?
236.876	0.446	1	{breath}
238.277	0.757	1	Tape.
239.363	0.509	2	Tape?
239.380	1.045	1	I did an archive.
239.380	0.841	3	Oh, I'm sorry.
239.851	1.553	0	Oh, on the tape. Ah.
240.732	0.286	2	Oh.
240.919	1.961	1	So I'm archiving it, and then I'm gonna delete ..
242.880	0.747	1	the files,
243.627	1.032	1	so that will give us
243.793	0.883	2	Eleven hours?
244.650	0.819	0	Wow.
244.659	2.244	1	ten gigabytes of free space.
245.202	0.262	2	Oh.
245.951	0.533	4	{lip smack}
246.484	2.53	4	Yeah, the archiving m- .. program does take a long time.
246.903	0.887	1	{laugh}
247.955	0.394	2	Yeah.
247.957	0.565	1	and - and -
249.143	0.222	1	Yep.
249.552	0.938	1	And so one- ..
250.490	1.41	1	that - that will be done, like,
252.330	1.113	1	in about two hours,
253.443	0.857	1	and so uh,
254.300	0.63	1	{inbreath}
254.930	2.223	1	at that point we'll be able to record five more meetings.
257.153	1.206	1	So .. {laugh}
257.248	0.398	2	Yeah.
257.635	0.278	4	{inbreath}
257.913	4.287	4	One thing - The good news about that - that is that once - once it's archived, it's pretty quick to get back.
258.561	0.263	2	Yeah.
262.200	1.969	4	I mean, it- it- it - the other direction is fast,
262.419	0.295	3	Is it?
263.226	0.281	1	Right.
264.169	1.289	3	Hmm.
264.169	1.565	4	but this direction is really slow.
265.386	0.326	2	Yeah.
265.599	2.391	1	Well, especially because I'm generating a clone, also.
